## General info
Suppose that you were given two circuit boards (S and L), where S contains n power sources, while L contains n
LEDs. The sources on S are sorted in ascending order <1, 2, 3, … , n>, while the LEDs on L are not <2, 9, 5, 14, 3, 
…>. This project connect each LED in L to its pair in S (i.e., 1 with 1, 2 with 2) through unshielded wires, 
thus when a wire connects a LED (li) in L with its corresponding source in S (si), it may prevent other LEDs from 
being connected (no two wires may cross).
so this project is made to to find the best pairs to be connected, so the maximum number of LEDs are lighted.
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* java
* javaFx
## Setup
>input: you should have a file contains the order of  numbers.
>To run this project, install it locally.
## Screenshots
>You can choose randomly the number of leds Or  a file that contains the order of leds .

>Click the first Button to calculate max number of leds with random order then a second stage will appear and input is number of leds e.g:6

>When you click to the run button another stage will appear and its contain the maximum number of led light and it calculate dynamic table
